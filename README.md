This Restful api is a CRUD of projects and their tasks, made just for fun/learn.

This challenge came from a bootcamp offered by @rocketseat, where we learn these following technologies: NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native.

### Built With

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
